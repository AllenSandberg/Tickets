The driver is given a menu of options (cancel report/legal sentence/lawyer consultation). If he chooses report cancellation, he’s requested to upload his police traffic report, id and proofs.  The application’s OCR implementation , based on Google Vision’s Text detection API scans the traffic report photo and converts it to JSON data. The driver can either capture and scan his report, or manually submit its details in the report form. After capturing his police traffic report, he can see the scanning results on the police traffic report form screen. He proceeds to fill the missing information in the app’s form & sends all data to the Traffic Consultant Office for advice. He can track his request’s status ongoing through the mobile application’s implemented push notification.

The client’s application is written in Java and is intended for Android mobile phone users. It is implemented in Android Studio’s workspace
